# Arduino: Automatic-Waste-Segregator
An Arduino-based smart device that separates dry and wet waste(based on moisture).
It uses infrared sensor to detect whether or not waste is present on flip board. 
It employs an infrared sensor to determine whether or not garbage article is present on the flip board.
If waste is present, the Arduino board will activate the moisture sensor, and if the moisture concentration
exceeds (room moisture level + a fixed value), the Arduino will rotate the servo (motor)Â left or right based on the moisture of waste.
